I am looking to create a personal website for me, Mark Alan Prior, to feature my personal projects. 

It should have a modern, airy feel with white background. Each project has a Name and Description. It will link to another website. It should have thumbnails. 

Header: There should be a cool circular photos of me. My name full name, "Mark Alan Prior" should appear in large font. There should be a tagline, "Build. Explore. Learn. Guide"

Footer: Should have basic contact info including email (mark@markalanprior) and my HQ: San Diego, CA. How about a link to current location? 

The site should look good on both desktop and mobile web.
